## Hammer & Brush

College life is demanding, and for many students, creative hobbies become casualties of hectic schedules. One of our team members experienced this firsthand—she struggled to maintain her artistic pursuits amid academic pressures, finding it increasingly difficult to stay motivated.

This isn’t a unique experience; it’s a **universal challenge for college students everywhere**. Creative outlets are essential for mental health, self-expression, and personal growth, yet they’re often the first thing students sacrifice when life gets busy.

We asked ourselves:

> **What if we could transform hobby tracking from a chore into something genuinely engaging and rewarding?**

That question became the foundation of **Hammer & Brush**—a platform designed to help students stay motivated, track creative time, and celebrate consistency through meaningful rewards.
